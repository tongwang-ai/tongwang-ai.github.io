Tong Wang is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Yale School of Management. Her research centers on developing machine learning solutions for complex business problems. She focuses on designing novel, interpretable models capable of effectively representing and analyzing both structured and unstructured data, including text and images. A unifying goal of her work is to enable stakeholders to extract meaningful insights from data and to make well-informed decisions while maintaining a clear understanding of how the underlying models operate.

Before joining Yale, Tong conducted research on machine learning methods addressing a range of real-world challenges. Her work on crime pattern detection has been featured in the Crime Analysis entry on Wikipedia, and key ideas from her algorithm were incorporated into the New York Police Department’s Patternizr system, which has been deployed citywide since 2016. She also developed an interpretable model for the 2018 FICO credit risk assessment challenge that surpassed the performance of several black-box machine learning approaches, earning her the FICO Recognition Award.
